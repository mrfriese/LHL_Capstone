# Project introduction

Leukemic cell identification (specifically Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia) project by image.

## workflow

Import appropriate picture data, and perform some EDA. Data is limited to pictures, so there is not really anything to do as far as 
data cleaning.
Create the first CNN model with pytorch and run through some small portion of data to evaluate if the model is working.
Investigate the progress of the model via graphs and metrics, like accuracy, precision, etc.
